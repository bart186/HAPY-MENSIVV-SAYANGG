# small world

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/Ma5a/pen/VwxBeLm](https://codepen.io/Ma5a/pen/VwxBeLm).

This started off as an UI experiment based on a small world that rotates. After adding a small character that can walk about, I wanted to give it add a reason for it to explore, so I added things for user to find by checking sign posts and talking to NPCs. You can navigate to different areas by clicking on the location bar on the top too. I added the bunny at the end to explain how to navigate.
